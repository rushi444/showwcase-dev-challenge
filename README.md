# Showwcase Developer Challenge

## Installation
- clone repo
- cd into showwcase-dev-challenge
- yarn
- yarn start

## Technologies
- Typescript
- React
- Redux
- React-Router
- Styled-Components
- React-Modal
- Jest & Enzyme for testing

## Notes
- Tried to keep 3rd party libraries to a miminum, wanted to build out functionality from scratch, I would normally use react-select and formik for the form
- Memoized form components for performance(doesn't help too much for a project of this size)
- Decided to sort education cards in decending order by last added, could sort by latest education by date if needed
- Wrote unit tests for all components

## Next Steps
- Authentication/Persist user data somewhere
- Drag and Drop to move education cards/titles
- Add autocomplete recommendations for Degree and Field of Study
